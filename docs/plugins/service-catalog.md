```yaml
plugins:
  - 'OAuth2'
  - 'Kubernetes'
  - 'ServiceCatalog'

kubernetes:
  - name: 'Development'
    context: 'dev-cluster'
    kubeconfig: ${HOME}/.kube/config
  - name: 'Production'
    context: 'prod-cluster'
    kubeconfig: ${HOME}/.kube/config
```

### **4. Advanced Configuration**

```yaml
service-catalog:
  storage:
    provider: 'filesystem'
    config:
      directory: './services'
      git_versioning: true
      commit_author_name: 'DashOPS'
      commit_author_email: 'dashops@yourcompany.com'

  # Default service configuration
  defaults:
    tier: 'TIER-3'
    impact: 'medium'

  # Health check configuration
  health:
    timeout: '30s'
    cache_ttl: '5m'
    batch_size: 10
```

## üìã Service Management

### **Service Definition Structure**

Services are defined using a structured YAML format:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: user-authentication
  tier: TIER-1
  created_at: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'
  created_by: 'john.doe'
  updated_at: '2024-01-15T14:20:00Z'
  updated_by: 'jane.smith'
  version: 3

spec:
  description: 'User authentication and authorization service'

  team:
    github_team: 'auth-squad'

  business:
    impact: 'high'
    sla_target: '99.9%'
    dependencies:
      - 'user-database'
      - 'oauth-provider'

        namespace: 'auth'
        resources:
          deployments:
            - name: 'auth-api'
              replicas: 5
              resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: '100m'
                  memory: '128Mi'
                limits:

        namespace: 'auth-staging'
        resources:
          deployments:
            - name: 'auth-api'
              replicas: 2

```

### **Service Tiers**

Services are classified into three tiers based on business impact:

| Tier       | Description | Characteristics                      | Example Services               |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **TIER-1** | Critical    | Revenue impact, customer-facing      | Payment API, Authentication    |
| **TIER-2** | Important   | Internal operations, indirect impact | User Management, Notifications |
| **TIER-3** | Standard    | Support functions, minimal impact    | Logging, Monitoring Tools      |

### **Team-based Ownership**

Services are owned by GitHub teams with automatic permission management:

- **Service Owners** - Can edit service definitions and configurations
- **Team Members** - Can view all team services and health status
- **Organization Members** - Can view public service information
- **External Users** - No access (requires authentication)

## üîç Service Discovery & Filtering

### **Search Capabilities**

The Service Catalog provides comprehensive search and filtering:

- **Text Search** - Service name, description, technology, team names
- **Team Filtering** - "My Team" services, specific team services, or all services
- **Tier Filtering** - Filter by service tier (TIER-1, TIER-2, TIER-3)
- **Status Filtering** - Filter by health status (healthy, degraded, critical, down)
- **Sort Options** - By name, tier, team, or last updated

### **Health Status Indicators**

Real-time health status with contextual meaning:

| Status       | Color     | Description                                   | Kubernetes Mapping                            |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Healthy**  | üü¢ Green  | All replicas running as expected              | Desired replicas = Ready replicas             |
| **Drift**    | üîµ Blue   | Service running but configuration out of sync | Replicas running < desired (but > 0)          |
| **Degraded** | üü° Yellow | Partial functionality, some issues            | Some replicas failing, errors in logs         |
| **Critical** | üü† Orange | Significant issues affecting functionality    | Most replicas failing, high error rates       |
| **Down**     | üî¥ Red    | Service completely unavailable                | No replicas running, deployment failed        |
| **Unknown**  | ‚ö™ Gray   | Health status cannot be determined            | No Kubernetes integration or data unavailable |

### **Statistics Dashboard**

Service overview with key metrics:

- **Total Services** - All registered services across teams
- **My Team Services** - Services owned by user's GitHub teams
- **Service Distribution** - Count by tier (TIER-1, TIER-2, TIER-3)
- **Critical Alerts** - Services requiring immediate attention
- **Editable Services** - Services user has permission to modify

## üìä Health Monitoring

### **Kubernetes Integration**

The Service Catalog automatically aggregates health information from Kubernetes:

```yaml
# Service definition includes Kubernetes contexts
kubernetes:
  environments:
    - name: 'production'
      context: 'prod-cluster'
      namespace: 'api'
      resources:
        deployments:
          - name: 'user-api'
            replicas: 3
```

**Health Calculation Logic:**

1. **Deployment Status** - Compare desired vs ready replicas
2. **Pod Health** - Check pod restart counts and error rates
3. **Resource Utilization** - Monitor CPU/memory usage
4. **Age Analysis** - Consider deployment age for stability assessment

### **Multi-Environment Health**

Services can span multiple environments with aggregated health:

- **Production** - Weighted highest in overall health calculation
- **Staging** - Secondary priority for health assessment
- **Development** - Informational only, minimal impact on overall status

### **Health API Endpoints**

```bash
# Get health for single service
GET /api/v1/service-catalog/services/{service-name}/health

# Get batch health for multiple services
POST /api/v1/service-catalog/services/health/batch
{
  "service_names": ["auth-api", "user-api", "payment-api"]
}
```

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "service_name": "user-authentication",
  "overall_status": "healthy",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "production",
      "status": "healthy",
      "deployments": [
        {
          "name": "auth-api",
          "status": "healthy",
          "replicas": {
            "desired": 5,
            "ready": 5,
            "available": 5
          },
          "last_updated": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "last_check": "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z"
}
```

## üîê Security & Permissions

### **Authentication Requirements**

Service Catalog requires OAuth2 authentication with GitHub:

```yaml
oauth2:
  github:
    clientId: ${GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
    clientSecret: ${GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
    org: 'your-organization' # Required for team membership
```

### **Permission Model**

**Read Permissions:**

- ‚úÖ **Organization Members** - Can view all service information
- ‚úÖ **Team Members** - Enhanced view for team-owned services
- ‚ùå **External Users** - No access without authentication

**Write Permissions:**

- ‚úÖ **Service Owners** - GitHub team members can edit team services
- ‚ùå **Other Teams** - Cannot modify services owned by other teams
- ‚ùå **Read-only Users** - Cannot create or modify any services

### **Team Resolution**

GitHub team membership is resolved at runtime:

1. **User Authentication** - OAuth2 GitHub token validation
2. **Organization Check** - Verify user is member of configured organization
3. **Team Membership** - Fetch user's team memberships via GitHub API
4. **Permission Mapping** - Match teams against service ownership

## üóÑÔ∏è Storage & Versioning

### **Filesystem Storage (Current)**

Services are stored as YAML files with Git versioning:

```
./services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-authentication.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment-processor.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notification-service.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (automatic Git repository for versioning)
```

**Git Integration:**

- **Automatic Commits** - Every service create/update triggers a Git commit
- **User Attribution** - Commits include the authenticated user's information
- **Version History** - Full Git history for all service changes
- **Branch Strategy** - Single main branch with linear history

### **Planned Storage Providers**

**GitHub Repository Storage** (Roadmap):

```yaml
service-catalog:
  storage:
    provider: 'github'
    config:
      repository: 'your-org/service-definitions'
      branch: 'main'
      path: 'services/'
      oauth2_client: true # Use OAuth2 GitHub client
```

**S3 Storage** (Roadmap):

```yaml
service-catalog:
  storage:
    provider: 's3'
    config:
      bucket: 'company-service-catalog'
      prefix: 'services/'
      aws_client: true # Use AWS plugin client
```
